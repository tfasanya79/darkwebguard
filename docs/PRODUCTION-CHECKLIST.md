## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Verify all services are running
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Test frontend functionality
- [ ] Check health endpoints
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate (if applicable)
- [ ] Test user registration/login

### First Week
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Check system resource usage
- [ ] Verify backup systems
- [ ] Test recovery procedures
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

### Monthly Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Test backup recovery

- [ ] Performance optimization review

## Production Environment Validation

### Service Health
```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test frontend
curl http://localhost:80

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}'

# Test API documentation
curl http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Performance Baselines
- Response time < 500ms for API calls
- Frontend load time < 3 seconds
- Database query time < 100ms
- Memory usage < 512MB per service
- CPU usage < 50% under normal load

## Security Validation

### Network Security
- [ ] Only necessary ports exposed
- [ ] Firewall configured correctly
- [ ] SSL/TLS properly configured
- [ ] CORS origins restricted

### Application Security
- [ ] Strong passwords enforced
- [ ] JWT tokens properly secured
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] SQL injection protection verified
- [ ] XSS protection headers set

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Containers run as non-root
- [ ] File permissions correct
- [ ] Secrets not in code/logs
- [ ] Regular security updates planned

## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Stop current version
docker-compose down

# Restore from backup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.backup.yml up -d

# Verify rollback
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Restore database backup
pg_restore -d darkwebguard_prod backup_YYYYMMDD.sql
```
